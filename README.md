ðŸ“‘ Legal Document QA System (Multi-PDF + Summarization)

This Streamlit app allows users to upload multiple legal PDF documents and interact with them using AI-powered summarization and question answering. It leverages LangChain, Chroma vector store, HuggingFace embeddings, and Googleâ€™s Gemini (via LangChain) for natural language processing.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
      Upload Multiple PDFs â€“ Users can upload one or more legal documents in PDF format.
      Text Processing â€“ Each PDF is split into smaller, manageable text chunks for better retrieval.
      Vector Database (Chroma) â€“ All document chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database for semantic search.
      Summarization â€“ Automatically generates easy-to-understand summaries of each document using Gemini and a custom prompt.
      Preview Chunks â€“ Displays the first few text chunks to verify document processing.
      Question Answering â€“ Users can ask natural language questions about the uploaded documents. The system retrieves relevant chunks and provides simplified, lawyer-friendly answers.
      Google Gemini LLM â€“ Uses gemini-1.5-flash for fast, accurate, and context-aware responses.
